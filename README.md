At the same time, similar to DeFi, the quality of NFT projects is varied, and investors may easily fall into the “liquidity trap”.In fact, in the world of blockchain, whether as an investor or a beginner, you can rely on data to stay away from “hearsay” and decide which NFT to buy by yourself. Analytics dashboards and reports can be created to know more about NFT. By using analytics tools to identify patterns and discrepancies, traders, builders, and collectors can gain a competitive edge in a brand new market.
